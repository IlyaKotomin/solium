-- The glass style's rules, for every window it frames but a fullscreen one,
-- which has no frame and keeps direct scanout (a fullscreen window has no
-- frame, so no style's rule reaches it anyway; the match says so here too,
-- where the rule is read):
--
-- * the shipped `glass` effect behind the whole pane, frame and client
--   together, cut to the window's outline, every corner rounded at the
--   window's (Pane.qml's `client.radius`). So the window is one piece of
--   glass, with one rim round its rounded outline and no seam where the bar
--   meets the client.
-- * the shipped `shade` in front of the whole pane while the window does not
--   have the keyboard: a thin dark edge just inside its rounded outline,
--   round all four sides and through the corners. Drawn on the GPU from the
--   window's shape alone, once per size; its `fade` brings it in as the
--   window loses the keyboard and takes it away as it gets it back, the
--   compositor blending the edge it has at another opacity on each frame.
--
-- Your own `effects.rules` win over these for the same part and slot:
-- `{ match = { style = "glass" }, part = "pane", slot = "behind", effect = false }`
-- takes the glass away, and `effect = { "glass", haze = 1 }` there gives it
-- other params; `slot = "front"` the same for the shade, such as
-- `effect = { "shade", width = 6, strength = 0.7 }`, with a `fade` of its own.
