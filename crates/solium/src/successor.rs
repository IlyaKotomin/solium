//! Where the keyboard goes when the window that had it closes: the words of
//! `config.focus.after_close` (#128), and the geometry its `"neighbour"` is
//! chosen by.
//!
//! **Asked of geometry, because the compositor knows no layouts.** "The window
//! that takes its place" is a question about a tiling tree or a scrolling
//! strip, and neither lives on this side: they are Lua. What every layout
//! leaves behind is the same, though -- where each window is going -- so the
//! answer is read from that. Of the windows still on the monitor the closed
//! one was on, one going into the rectangle it stood in: in tiling the
//! sibling that grows into the space, in scrolling the column that slides
//! into it. Where none goes into any of it -- a strip that keeps its last
//! column where it was, a layout that waits for the application to go, a
//! floating desktop -- the one nearest to it. Between several, the window
//! focused most recently: two tiles that grow into one space take it by a
//! pixel more or less each, and which of them is a pixel wider says nothing
//! about which the user was working in.
//!
//! Each word is one way of answering; `config.focus.after_close` lists them in
//! order per mode, and the first that finds a window wins. See
//! `Solium::successor` in `state/keyboard.rs`, which reads them, and the tests
//! named on each word.
