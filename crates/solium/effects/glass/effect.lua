-- Liquid glass: a frosted slab of glass over the part. The backdrop is
-- blurred and veiled, dark by default (`tint`; `{ 1, 1, 1, 0.11 }` is the
-- light look); across the rim (the bezel) the glass magnifies toward
-- its centre and pulls in from the edge, strongest at the very edge, so the
-- backdrop curves around the edge (and with a strong lens, mirrors there:
-- the glassy lip). A thin highlight runs along the edges facing the light,
-- a fainter one along the far edges with a soft shade under it.
-- Solium's own design and code. Every number below is a param.

-- Its input is the backdrop, what is behind the part, from xray: behind a
-- translucent window it frosts and bends what lies behind it.
--   { match = { app_id = "kitty" }, part = "client", slot = "behind", effect = "glass" }
-- Copy this folder to ~/.config/solium/effects/glass/ to change it; your copy
-- is used instead, everywhere that names `glass`.
