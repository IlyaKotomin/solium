-- An edge shade: a thin band just inside the part's rounded outline, round
-- all four sides and through the corners, darkest at the very edge and gone
-- `width` pixels in. Solium's own design and code. Every number is a param.
--
-- It reads nothing of the frame, only the part's shape (tier T0): it runs
-- once, and again only when the part's size or its params change, whatever
-- the window draws, and needs no capture. The `glass` pane style puts it in
-- front of a window without the keyboard, fading in and out with the focus
-- (the rule's `fade`):
--   { match = { focused = false }, part = "pane", slot = "front", effect = "shade",
--     fade = { duration = 240, easing = "outCubic" } }
-- Copy this folder to ~/.config/solium/effects/shade/ to change it; your copy
-- is used instead, everywhere that names `shade`.
